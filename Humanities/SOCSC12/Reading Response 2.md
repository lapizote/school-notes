Quijano:
- "In this way, race became the fundamental criterion for the distribution of the world population into ranks, places, and roles in the new society’s structure of power." p. 258
- "Legitimizing the already old ideas and practices of relations of superiority/inferiority between dominant and dominated." p. 258
Lorde:
- "But community must not mean a shedding of our differences, nor the pathetic pretense that these differences do not exist." p. 2
Bookchin:
- "‘Imagination to power’, as the French students said. ‘Be practical, do the impossible’"
- "So to do the impossible is the most rational and practical thing we can do." (p. 8)
Docot:
- "...they signal that decolonization is a challenging project in a context in which the aftermaths of multiple colonialisms have muddled daily life." (p. 16)
