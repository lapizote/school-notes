are In the fourth industrial revolution, digital analytics enables a new level of operational productivity.

### Cyber Physical System
- Maturation of new cyber physical technologies (AI, 3-D printing, robotics)
- Data analytics driving efficacy and effectiveness and new business models
- Pervasive sensing and actuation
- Ubiquitous connectivity throughout the supply chain
- Unprecedented levels of data and increased computing powers
### Examples
- Increased need for data -AI and data analytics, increase production, make production more efficient and transport the products faster
- Ubiquitous connectivity - because of this the Internet of Things will be easier to implement, enabling technology to become more common in our daily lives.
- Improve sensor and actuator design, health, energy, environment, and sustainability as well as media comunication.
- Maturation of cyber physical systems will lead to more technology such as self-driving cars and trucks and other smart machines.
- Changes in financial systems through the use of blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies.
### Inequality
- More importantly, though the 1st and 2nd industrial revolution brought about prosperity and business expansion, there were some segments of society that were deeply affected and became more impoverished.
- Similarly, economists foresee that during the full implementation of automation of the 4th industrial revolution, the disparity between those who can afford the technology and those who cannot will become amplified since the benefits of an increased quality of lie will primarily go to the first group.
### Jobs
- McKinsey Global Institute - about 800 million jobs worldwide will be lost to automation by 2030.
- Universal basic income - All citizens of these countries will be given a monthly income by their governments whether they are employed or not.
