"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human." - Alan Turing, 1950

Of course, machines can be intelligent. Computers are able to solve complex mathematical equations, why would one even cast doubt on the intelligence of machines?

### The Definition of Intelligence
- Solve equations = intelligence?
- What does a machine actually do when it solves equations?
- True intelligence = Involves a real understanding of the problem at hand, and a true judgement on the strategies that can be implemented to solve it.
### What is Artificial Intelligence?
- Alan Turing and John McCarthy
- Definitions of AI vary
- Artificial Intelligence is the study of systems that:
	- Think like humans
	- Act like humans
	- Think rationally
	- Act rationally
### Foundations of AI
- Philosophy: logic, mind, knowledge
- Mathematics: proof, computability, probability
- Economics: maximizing payoffs
- Neuroscience: brain and neurons
- Psychology: though, perception, action
- Control Theory: stable feedback sstems
- Linguistics: knowledge representation, syntax
### Demystifying Artificial Intelligence
Machine Learning and Value of Big Data vs. Agent-Based Artificial Intelligence
### What of Artificial Intelligence and Our Lives?
- The Internet of Things
- Network of Digital Assistants
- Self-Automated Cars
- Automation of Tasks in Existing Jobs
	- Are we going to be replaced?
##### Facts
- As of 2017, Foxconn, a key manufacturing partner for Amazon, Google, and Apple, has replaced 60,000 workers with robots.
- It is also no secret that the U.S. Department of Defense is using approximately 7,000 RQ-11 drones in deployment in various Middle East conflict situations.
##### Counter-Argument
- AI will most probably relieve us from repetitive and monotonous tasks within a job.
- Instead of being replaced, the human aspect of the job will be given more time to address the interactions involved in human relationships in the context of the job, as well as perform human duties of critical thinking, leading to creative problem solving.
### Responsibility
- Balance between AI and human intelligence is achieved with conscious effort.
- It is true that machines are replacing entire jobs, and so it is the responsibility of the work-providing forces of society and AI architects to progress this AI trend by achieving the synergy that humans and machines can produce together, rather than have total replacements in the context of employment.
### AI for Mining
##### Mine Site Monitoring
- A physical platform for sensing contaminants (in air, water, soil) in gold mining communities.
- AI is used to predict contamination levels given current data
- AI is also used to approximate contamination even if data inputs are incomplete.
##### Smart Farming: Fighting Fungal Disease of Bananas
From Soil to Mobile Microscope to Phone App Equipped with AI
### AI: Conclusion
- Taking the form ofmachine learning and/or agent-based automations, AI is now considered to be ubiquitous.
- With AI incrementally penetrating the human lifestyle, it is not without its benefits and consequences. The goal for automation does contribute t the threat against the human workforce in varying degrees. However, we must not forget that the control and regulation of current and emerging AI-based technologies are responsibilities set upon us.
- Artificial intelligence can be dangerous, but only as much as we allow it to be.
